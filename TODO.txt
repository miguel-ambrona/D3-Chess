 * Double-check that ignoring pawn visitors in semistatic is sound.

 * Improve the detection of unwinnable positions in blocked positions where the
     checking bishop must check from a (non-defended) square next to the Loser's king
     (and therefore can be captured by the Loser's king). These positions are now
     classified as 'potentially winnable', but they could be classified correctly
     as 'unwinnable'.
