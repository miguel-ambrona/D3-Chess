 * Improve helpmates in blocked positions: only bishops will be involved, so we need
     to reward variations that place bishops in their expected squares for the mate.
     (Right now the 'going_to_square' function only cares about 'slow' pieces like
     kings and knights, but not bishops.)

 * Improve the detection of unwinnable positions in blocked positions where the
     checking bishop must check from a (non-defended) square next to the Loser's king
     (and therefore can be captured by the Loser's king). These positions are now
     classified as 'potentially winnable', but they could be classified correctly
     as 'unwinnable'.

 * Improve helpmates in general. Some mating sequences (especially with many pieces)
     are unreasonably long. Maybe sort the moves by ourselves before the search instead
     of relying on the sorting provided by Stockfish?
